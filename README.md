based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

a place to store my config whilst learning neovim...

the original goal was to break up the kickstart config for easier consumption

some additional plugins to help along the journey,
- neo-tree, a file/project browser, opens with <C-\\>
- toggleterm, to access the terminal, opens with <C-`>
- nightfly, a darker theme with higher contrast for my oldschool eyeballs
